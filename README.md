# EduPlatform - Educational Management System

## üìã Project Overview

**Project Name:** EduPlatform  
**Objective:** Develop an educational platform similar to Kundalik.com using Python with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system operates without a traditional backend database, storing all data in-memory using classes, lists, and dictionaries.

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.x
- OOP Principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
- In-memory data storage (no database required)
- Export capabilities: XLSX, CSV, and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

**User Roles:**
- **Admin:** System management, user creation/deletion
- **Teacher:** Assignment creation, grading, schedule management
- **Student:** Assignment submission, grade viewing
- **Parent:** Child progress monitoring
